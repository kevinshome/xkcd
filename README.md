xkcd
========

A simple script utilizing Pillow to display an xkcd comic. Can fetch either the
latest comic, a random comic, or a specific comic by number. In the terminal window, 
the script displays the comic number, title, release date, and alt-text. This script
is made possible thanks to the xkcd JSON API (https://xkcd.com/json.html).

To install this script, run the following command:
```
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhtnr/xkcd/main/install.py | python3 -
